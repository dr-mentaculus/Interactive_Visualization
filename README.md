# Interactive_Visualization

This is a fun little project.

I wrote the code below to complete one of the data visualization projects for University of Michigan's *Applied Data Science with Python* series, avaiable through Coursera. I chose to complete an interactive visualization, the hardest challenge available, in order to gain more practice working with Matplotlib.

The idea behind the interactive visualization is provided in this [paper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Ferreira_Fisher_Sample_Oriented_Tasks.pdf). The basic idea is that users can decide on the interval within which they want the mean value to fall, and the different bars will change colors to show the probability that the mean of that dataset falls within the interval.

Admittedly, nothing too serious is going on here. But it was a chance to learn more about the Matplotlib library. And watching the colors shift as you move the interval bars up and down can be fun.
